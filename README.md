## BungeeCordPE

BungeeCordPE is port of BungeeCord for Bukkit. It's better than TransferPacket, because Transfer is more smooth and you can communicate with other servers trough API.

I accept pull requests if they will have any logic. Other Pull requests will be closed and owner will be banned if he/she spam.<br>
If there'll be more people making Pull Requests, project will be moved to organization.
